        "I’d always thought of Jock McFadyen’s paintings, which I first encountered a couple of decades ago, as something like postcards from a post-apocalyptic future. This is what the city will have become, they seemed to announce, in the future perfect tense. The city will have been radically depopulated. Its buildings will have been abandoned. London’s East End edgelands will have encroached on its ancient high streets. The city’s air will hum with an eerie silence. Spending the day with McFadyen last winter, shortly after the end of a strict Covid lockdown, I understood that we already inhabit this city. Walking from his home in Bethnal Green to his studio beside London Fields, after a morning spent talking and drinking coffee, we encountered a scattered population of people who were only tentatively returning to the city from which they had been excluded. On the streets and canal paths, under a cold, bright sun that almost made one’s eyes ache, they were reconnoitring it with curiosity and uncertainty.",

        "In January 1879, he took up a post as a missionary at Petit-Wasmes[53] in the working class, coal-mining district of Borinage in Belgium. To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person and moved to a small hut, where he slept on straw.[54] His humble living conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him for undermining the dignity of the priesthood. He then walked the 75 kilometres (47 mi) to Brussels,[55] returned briefly to Cuesmes in the Borinage, but he gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880,[note 3] which caused concern and frustration for his parents. His father was especially frustrated, and advised that his son be committed to the lunatic asylum in Geel.[57][58][note 4]",

        "Next, why are man and bird bipeds, but fish footless; and why do man and bird, though both bipeds, have an opposite curvature of the legs. For man bends his legs convexly, a bird has his bent concavely; again, man bends his arms and legs in opposite directions, for he has his arms bent convexly, but his legs concavely. And a viviparous quadruped bends his limbs in opposite directions to a man's, and in opposite directions to one another; for he has his forelegs bent convexly, his hind legs concavely. Again, quadrupeds which are not viviparous but oviparous have a peculiar curvature of the limbs laterally away from the body. Again, why do quadrupeds move their legs criss-cross?",

Bring a big saucepan of water to a boil and gently lower the eggs into the water, using a tablespoon. Cook for 5-6 minutes. Fish the eggs out with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl of ice-cold water. Peel and halve, when cooled completely. Make the sauce. Put all the ingredients – peppers, paprika, lemon juice in a liquidiser and squeeze in the garlic that you’ve roasted with potatoes (discard the skin). Blend all, until well combined and smooth. ",
